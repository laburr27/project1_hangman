Guesses
  Prompt user for input or word guess (letters only, give invalid input alert for non-letter input)
    If word guess, compare to word string
      If word guess is correct, user wins
      If word guess is wrong, add body part to noose
    Scan array for match
      If a match exists:
        Reveal blank(s)
        Delete instances from array (i.e. guess 'o' for 'moose' = delete both 'o' in array)
        Add guessed letter to guess array (displayed for user)
      If no match:
        Add guessed letter to guess array
        Add body part (head, face, neck, arms, midsection, legs) to noose
          If legs are added, game ends
    If word is guessed:
      Congrats, ask to play again
    If legs aren't added and word not guessed:
      Prompt user for input again (include guessed letter array)
        If guess is in guessed letter array:
          Alert that letter has been guessed, try again
          Prompt for new guess
