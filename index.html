      <h3>You're Hanging By Our Every Word!</h3>
      <p id='top-line'>Rules:</p>
      <p>Guess a letter.  If the letter is in the word, it'll be shown in the blanks.  If you think you know the word, you can guess it at any time.  For each wrong guess, a body part will be added to the gallows.  You have five guesses- one for the head, neck, arms, torso, and legs.  And remember- if you lose, don't get too <span id='italic'>hung</span> up on it!  Good luck!</p>
